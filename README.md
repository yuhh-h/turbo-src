hello

We at [Reibase](https://reibase.rs) created the open-source protocol Turbosrc. It only allows token holders to engage with pull requests. Maintainers create tokens for their project via Turbosrc. They can distribute or sell these into their communities. Token holders vote on pull requests - accept or deny. Each project (likely maintainers) creates their own set of tokens.

Turbosrc software will also tokenize itself, creating value for our contributor community. If you're interested in contributing, see the contributor section below. If you'd like to join our team, please reach out to us at Reibase.
